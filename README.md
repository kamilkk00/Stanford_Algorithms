# Stanford Algorithms - Coursera

This repository contains solutions to the programming assignments from the **"Algorithms"** course taught by Professor Tim Roughgarden on the Coursera platform. This course is one of the most highly regarded in the world in the field of algorithms and data structures, offering solid theoretical foundations as well as practical skills needed to solve complex algorithmic problems.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into **four sub-courses**, each focusing on key aspects of algorithms. They combine algorithm theory with practical application, making the course ideal for both computer science students and developers looking to deepen their knowledge in this field.

### 1. **Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms**
   The first part of the course focuses on divide-and-conquer algorithms, sorting, and searching. Randomized algorithms are also discussed. Key topics include:
   - Computational complexity and algorithm analysis.
   - Implementation and understanding of algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
   - Search techniques and fundamentals of randomized algorithms.

### 2. **Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures**
   The second part of the course focuses on graph algorithms and data structures. Key search algorithms and shortest path algorithms are introduced. Main topics include:
   - Graph search: BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).
   - Shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm.
   - Time and space complexity of graph algorithms.
   - Introduction to data structures, such as hash tables, trees, and heaps.

### 3. **Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming**
   The third part of the course discusses greedy algorithms, minimum spanning trees, and dynamic programming. These techniques are extremely useful in optimization. Covered topics include:
   - Greedy algorithms: theory and applications.
   - Algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees, such as Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms.
   - Introduction to dynamic programming, including classic problems like the knapsack problem.

### 4. **Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems, and What To Do About Them**
   The final part of the course deals with advanced graph algorithms and introduces NP-complete problems. Key topics include:
   - A revisit of shortest path algorithms, such as Bellman-Ford.
   - NP-complete problems: definition, significance, and examples.
   - Heuristic techniques and approximation algorithms used to solve computationally difficult problems.

## What You'll Find in the Repository

This repository contains solutions to the programming assignments from each of the above sub-courses. Each assignment is designed to practically apply the knowledge gained during the lectures. The solutions are written in Python and aim to optimize both time and memory performance of the algorithms.
